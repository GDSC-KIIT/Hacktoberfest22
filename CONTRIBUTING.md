# Contribution Guidelines

We are accepting:

1. Your original projects and ideas
2. DSA / Algorithm codes

There is no restriction on language for either.

## Original Projects

When contributing an original project, please ensure that you:

- Create a separate directory for it
- Add a relevant README.md within the directory that contains:
  1. Your name
  2. Brief description about what your project is 
  3. Any relevant screenshots or links    
- Do NOT pull separate PRs to later on fix your README.md

## DSA / Algorithms

When contributing DSA Algos:

- Keep them all in one directory
- Make a comment on the top of your code that mentions you as the contributor
- Do not repeat handled questions
- Add a working screenshot of your code in the PR description

_NOTE:_ Ensure that you stick to these guidelines else your PR may get marked as spam or invalid. Also, not mentioning your name as the contributor in your code/directory may lead to you getting left out when we evaluate to find the top 3 contributors.
